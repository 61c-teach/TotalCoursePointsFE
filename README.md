# Total Course Points Frontend

Autograder to generate total course points for students.

A roster MUST have the following fields:
Name,SID,Email
Optional fields include:
Secret,Extensions

I have added the prelim files with some examples of how you can use Total Course Points including grades and extensions in google sheets. I have not finished adding the assignments to those but hopefully that can give people a good idea to how this works.
